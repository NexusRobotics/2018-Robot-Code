# 2018-Robot-Code

I think this should be a working repository that should sync through ecplise

steps to set up first software and sync with github

#1: install eclipse by following the guide at "http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/599681-installing-eclipse-c-java" since we are using java and not c++ skip the "Installing the C++ Toolchain" step

make sure you download a java 8 JDK

#2: if you want to ba able to upload to the robot or control it from your laptop instead of just pushing code. install the FRC update suite by following "http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/599671-installing-the-frc-update-suite-all-languages" I think you have to make an account on NI in order to download the files

#3: install the pheonix framework from "http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/hro.html#product_tabs_technical_resources" I think this might only be avaliable for windows but im not sure.

there is both a download to the installer and a link to a guide on that page if you need guidance

#4:install the navx libraries from "https://www.pdocs.kauailabs.com/navx-mxp/software/roborio-libraries/java/"

#5: in your eclipse workspace go to File > import > git > import from git.  in github click clone/download and copy the link.  in eclipse paste the url and enter your username and password.  when it asks to make a repository make a new empty folder somewhere seapearate from your workspace. eg C:/Users/%USERNAME%/nexusgit

in order to acces github functions from eclipse right-click on the project and near the bottom of the meanu there is a menu titled "Team" from there yo should be able to make commits, push and pull and well as switch branchs

If you want to write some code to test try making a new branch and puching it to github. 

try to write the code subsystems in different branchs for now
